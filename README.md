Experts Groq 
This repository contains a Streamlit application that allows users to interact with a conversational chatbot powered by the Groq API. The application uses a list of starter prompts to initiate the conversation and maintains a history of the conversation to provide context for the chatbot's responses.

Features
Conversational Interface: The application provides a conversational interface where users can ask questions or make statements, and the chatbot responds accordingly.

Contextual Responses: The application maintains a history of the conversation, which is used to provide context for the chatbot's responses.

Customization: Users can customize the Groq model used for generating responses and the length of the conversational memory.

Starter Prompts
The starter prompts are stored in a text file located in the root directory:
starter_prompts.txt: Contains a list of prompts that users can use to start the conversation with the chatbot.

Functions
chat_with_groq(client, prompt, model): Sends a chat message to the Groq API and returns the content of the response.

get_conversational_history(user_question_history, chatbot_answer_history, conversational_memory_length): Generates a full prompt for the chatbot based on the history of the conversation.

get_random_prompt(file_path): Reads a file of prompts and returns a random prompt.

main(): The main function of the application, which initializes the Groq client, sets up the Streamlit interface, and handles the chat interaction.
